Foreign organized crime rings used PayPal to launder funds from stolen credit card numbers the obtained on the black market. They created numerous  PayPal accounts using automated scripts and connected them to the stolen credit cards. They would then use these fraudulent "buyer" accounts to make payments to fraudulent "seller" accounts, and initiate an ACH transfer to get the funds out of PayPal's system and into a bank account, where they could withdraw the money. As the merchant of record, PayPal was financially responsible for these fraudulent payments, even though PayPal itself was not doing anything wrong. 

As the costs escalated into the millions of dollars, it became critical that PayPal discover a way to curtail fraud without becoming overly restrictive in a way that would damage its growth. The company attacked the Mafia problem on several fronts. Max Levchin and his engineering team built pattern recognition software that helped identify suspicious activities. Max and David Gausebeck  developed the Gausebeck-Levchin test, a CAPTCHA tool that restricted crime rings' ability to automate account creation. And the company's team of fraud investigators researched possible criminal activity and worked with law enforcement. Over time, the rate of fraudulent transactions tumbled and PayPal became one of the safest online payment networks.
