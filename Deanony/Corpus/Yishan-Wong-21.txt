I'm astounded at the overly-intellectualized answers here.  I mean, are you kidding me?  You seriously think most people even know what "Fair Use" really means?

The answer is simpler than that: Normal people don't think about copyright infringement.

I never quite realized it until this question was asked, but "copyright" is a pretty nerdy thing in and of itself.  You know what normal people do?  They see a picture on the web (or in a book, or in a magazine, or newspaper), and they want to share it with their friends, so they cut it out or copy it or save it to their hard drive, and then they post it or mail it or link to it wherever it is that they want to share it.

To a normal person, the thought process is this:  "Oh, I saw something interesting.I want to share it with someone so I will take a copy and put it somewhere else."  That's what's going on, that's why copyright infringement is "rampant" on Quora and everywhere else on the internet.  Because people want to share things they see (or hear, or read, or... etc) and it's such a fundamental human activity that some legal construct like "copyright infringement" is not going to enter the minds of 99% of normal human beings.
