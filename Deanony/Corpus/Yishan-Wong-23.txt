There are a lot of artists who die early(-ish) due to tragic downward spirals, and while those deaths are typically mentioned as part of their biography, over time the world tends to remember them for their work and in particular, the pinnacle of their achievements.  The biography usually tends to be "this artist did this awesome thing, and this other amazing thing, and oh yeah, they died tragically as you might expect."
