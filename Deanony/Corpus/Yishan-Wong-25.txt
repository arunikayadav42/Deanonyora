Protecting a stranger's laptop carries the same moral obligation as upholding the sanctity of private property rights when you yourself have no personal interest in that property.

Therefore, you should protect a stranger's laptop with the same zeal and vigor that a libertarian would work to protect the abstract notion of property rights.

In other words, you should be willing to debate vigorously online and maybe make a few peevishly awkward comments in the company of friends and acquaintances about it, expressing outraged disapproval should someone attempt to possess the laptop without the informed consent of the rightful owner.
