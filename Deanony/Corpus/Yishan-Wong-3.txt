Technically yes, in the sense that they are cash-flow positive, but generally the tolls are used to pay back the bonds that were sold to finance the construction of the bridge.

This may not be the case with privately-owned bridges on entirely private land, which may exist purely to generate cash-flow.

For example, see the campaign brochure for the Golden Gate Bridge's original bond issuance: http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist10/s...

The bridge's construction was financed originally by a bond issuance of $35M (in 1930).  The tolls subsequently charged would be used to pay back the bonds plus interest, pay for maintenance, and accumulate a sufficient lump sum of profit such that interest derived from the sum would suffice to pay for ongoing maintenance indefinitely.  Once the bonds were repaid and this excess sum was achieved, the tolls would cease and the bridge would be free.

This isn't what ended up happening; today the bridge still has tolls but is part of a toll network wherein drivers are charged tolls going "into" the Peninsula.  Here's more information on what the tolls are used for today: http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/ind...
