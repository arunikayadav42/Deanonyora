I imagine you are encountering a problem that is something like:

As you pick them up from the paper liner, they stick a little and tear, spilling the soup into the surrounding area.
They are a little soggy or saggy, or they have a small leak, so when you try to pick them up with your chopsticks, they leak all over as you bring it your mouth.
You are trying to bite them open, and there is an explosion of soup as you do so onto and around your face.

I'm also guessing that the solution of "pop them into your mouth all at once" may be impractical because they usually come out steaming hot so if you do that, once it bursts in your mouth, you would get scalded.  Furthermore, you can't wait for them to cool down to a warm state because, bizarrely, these things somehow pass through the "warm" state and right into the "too cold" state very quickly.

If any of these constraints are not true, you've probably figured out a good way to eat them by now; these are, in my experience, the "maximally adversarial" circumstances under which one tends to encounter soup dumplings.

So if all of this is the case, here's the best way I've found:

Get one soup dumpling into a small bowl.  You can also use a teacup.  Try to get it there intact; if it breaks, the soup is probably gone by now and it's just a loss.
Take a chopstick and stab it firmly into the meaty core.  Use this to lift it to your mouth, holding the bowl/cup underneath your chin.
Take a small bite near the top of the dumpling skin, near the weakest portion of the skin, as best you can detect.
Try to suck out as much soup as you can, given the temperature of the soup.
Once you have deflated the dumpling of enough soup, pop the rest of it in your mouth.


Good luck; please post some pics.
