I'm the first person to condone bluntly telling people that they're stupid, but in this case there are a lot of ways to do this without offending:

The easiest way is to just answer the different question that you think should be asked.  As long as your answer says some worthwhile stuff, the mindless drones on Quora will still upvote it[1], and probably the original asker will still appreciate the net-positive knowledge you've imparted.
You don't need to actually criticise the question itself.  Just say, "Well, a good way of looking at this question is to first ask a similar question, like '<whatever the better question is>.'"  Typically this can be said completely honestly, because the better version you are proposing gets at the heart of the issue anyways.  If you really want, at the end of your answer, you can then connect your answer to the exact question that was asked, and that usually covers it.
You can also say, "I don't really know the answer to your exact question, but I can answer a similar and related question, which is '<the better question>' - hopefully my answer will be helpful."  If you're lucky, your re-articulated question addresses the asker's real concern, and you get full credit.

Pretty much all these strategies are variations on inserting what you think the better, more appropriate question is into the dialogue and just trying to power through by giving a worthwhile answer that yields some knowledge.  There's really no need to criticise the original question anyway, because it's not like the asker is going to interrupt in the middle of your answer and be like, "No, no, that's not what I asked, please answer my original flawed question" so in reality you can just say whatever the hell you want, and if you make your readers feel like they've gotten smarter - well, the upvotes justify the means.
