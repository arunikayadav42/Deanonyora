I have this theory that YouTube comments actually broke through a previously-unbroken "floor" on the crappiness of comments on internet forums:

The reason is that before YouTube, you have to remember that video on the internet was relatively rare.  You had all these codec and transmission problems,  broadband was still pretty rare, and there were certainly very few central repositories available to the casual user.  In this old world, most places where you could comment were textual in nature (forums, BBS, etc).  The thing with text-oriented sites is that, no matter how stupid you are, you still have to be literate in order to participate.  So you can be some kind of backwoods racist Neo-Nazi, but at least you are the guy writing their propaganda leaflets.

The thing is, we all thought that the population visiting and posting on these forums represented a full cross-section of humanity.  Not so!  Because you still had to be willing to read and write (however poorly) in order to participate, it still excluded the great mass of people for whom that is too much of a challenge, those who prefer to lie inert on their couches and have entertainment streamed to them via video.  These people hadn't yet made it onto the participatory parts of the internet, or maybe just spent most of their time online looking at porn.

Enter YouTube.  A new way for the masses to consume the internet, now presented in passive, video format.  Suddenly all these video-oriented mostly-illiterate users had a new place to be, they could watch funny videos all day.  They're not completely illiterate, of course - so when presented with a textbox beneath the video they're watching, they'll gladly mash some "lol whut herp derp" comment into it.  So what Youtube actually achieved was bringing a new class of even more illiterate user onto the internet and getting them to join into the dialogue[1].
